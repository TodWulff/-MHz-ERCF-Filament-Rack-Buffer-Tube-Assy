# ~MHz ERCF Filament Rack/Buffer Tube Assy

![~MHz ERCF Filament Rack/Buffer Tube Assy](https://github.com/[username]/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/image.jpg?raw=true)

The  'buffer tubes' are Betaduct 75mm*25mm solid wall raceways.  I got a set of 8ea 2m long pieces for roughly $120 from Newark.  The PVC flavor is what I bought.  The Noryl flavor is roughly 5x more expensive - be careful.  Those pictured above are 36" in length.  

I cobbled the end cap assy's together in PrusaSlicer (/me != 3D CAD skills).  Assembled Endcap: https://i.imgur.com/bq9zRUO.png  Each cap needs 2ea PC4-M10, 1ea 608RS Bearing, 1ea M3 Heat insert, 5ea M3x10 screws (4 to attach the hanger halves to the lid, one for the bearing axis).

The bowden comb is just extra that I added to the model - ensures that one has more than enough if multiple end caps are printed.

For the frame, I ordered a set of 10ea 1000mm lengths of 2020 from amazonia, in addition to a couple additional pieces I had stock on - used for the bottom anti-tip supports - printed feet/end caps (sharp edges will cut a toe or three off).  The 4 up rights are 1000mm, the lateral pieces are 650-ish mm.

I used a ton of roll-in M5 t-nuts and 2 sets of these to tie it all together: https://smile.amazon.com/KOOTANS-Bracket-Connection-Aluminum-Profile/dp/B07RPT9X8X , along with a set of these for the top of the verticals: https://smile.amazon.com/Befenybay-Connector-Aluminum-Extrusion-2020s-Black/dp/B092YS1SX3.

The 4 members holding the buffer tubes are just the left overs from lobbing the lateral pieces down to 650mm, trimmed to length to allow ample spacing between the buffers - I may actually squeeze the buffer wings tighter and trim the metal down more.  tbd.  This was a finalize the design while building evolution.

At the top of each buffer tube, I used this type of bit to plow a hole through on each side (used an extra printed cap as a guide) and then dyked the top of the material away to allow the cap to be slid on/off without having to unscrew anything: https://i.imgur.com/PGYzGqM.png - makes servicing a breeze.

M5x8 with roll-ins round it out and hold the tubes to the wings.  The bowden tube I used is here:  https://smile.amazon.com/MUYI-Chemical-Electrical-Medical-Equipment/dp/B019PZ5MY4.  It's 2mm ID but my orbiter v1.5 has plenty of pulling power, so no issues for me, with #4/#5 tophats driven by a NMEA 17 gear stepper (Y axis servo from my E3v2 in the printer graveyard).

Note:  Expect to have to do some post processing - Might want to make the bowden comb's cutouts (the negative volume modifiers) a bit larger - i.e. increase diameter by 0.2mm.  I had to go back and redrill all of them so the bowden tubes would slide in.
